Complete the method so that it formats the words into a single comma separated value. The last word should be separated by the word 'and' instead of a comma. The method takes in an array of strings and returns a single formatted string. Empty string values should be ignored. Empty arrays or null/nil values being passed into the method should result in an empty string being returned.

If the array of words is valid then i want to grab the elements in the array that are aslo valid.
store those elements with a comma after each one.
I then want to switch out the second to last comma with 'and' and cut the last comma off the new stored elements.
